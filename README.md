# Music-Streaming-App
A dynamic Music Streaming App powered by Flutter.

The music app UI that I have created in Flutter is a work in progress, designed to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for accessing and enjoying their favorite music.

Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a clean and minimalist home screen. The home screen includes a "Search" functionality, which allows users to search for specific artists, albums or songs. However, the search functionality is currently in progress and may not provide accurate results or have a refined user interface.

Next it display the treanding playlists and songs currently. It displays a grid of album covers, allowing users to explore and discover music easily. Upon clicking on the playlist or album cover the user is taken to an another screen where you can select to play the songs you want however, it is currently under progress.

Although the UI is incomplete, the design elements used so far include a combination of vibrant colors, smooth transitions, and visually appealing album artwork.
Please note that as an incomplete UI, some features and screens are not fully implemented or may be placeholders for future development. The purpose of this UI is to provide a foundation for further work and refinement to create a fully functional and engaging music app.

Overall, the UI I have created for the music app in Flutter demonstrates the potential for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface, with room for additional development to enhance its functionality and user experience.
